        <h2>For You ❤️</h2>
        <p>Hey Shayne,</p>
        <p>I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, and I figured it’s finally time to say it. Life’s too short for regrets, and if there’s one thing I don’t want to regret, it’s not telling you how I feel.</p>
        <p>From the moment we started talking, I knew there was something different about you. You have this energy that just pulls people in—not just because you’re beautiful, but because you’re real. You’re kind, smart, and effortlessly funny. And honestly? That’s rare.</p>
        <p>I don’t just like you—I admire you. The way you carry yourself, the way you make people around you feel comfortable, the way you light up a room without even trying. I catch myself looking forward to every conversation we have, every little moment, and before I knew it, you became someone I genuinely care about.</p>
        <p>I’m not saying this expecting anything in return. I respect you too much for that. I just wanted to be real with you because you deserve honesty. No matter what happens, I just want you to know that you’re someone special to me.</p>
        <p>Take your time, no pressure at all. Just wanted you to hear it straight from me.</p>
        <p>Nicko</p>
        <p class="heart">❤❤❤</p>
