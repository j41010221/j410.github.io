        <h2>For You ❤️</h2>
        <p>Hey [Crush’s Name],</p>
        <p>I’ve been meaning to tell you this for a while now, and I figured this would be the best way to express everything I feel without stumbling over my words. So here it goes…</p>
        <p>From the moment I met you, I knew you were someone special. There’s something about you—your smile, the way you laugh, the way you talk about the things you love—that makes everything around you seem brighter. I never thought I’d feel this way about someone, but somehow, you’ve made your way into my heart, and now, I can’t imagine my days without thinking about you.</p>
        <p>I love the little things about you, the ones you might not even notice—like how your eyes light up when you’re excited about something, how you unknowingly make my day better just by being around, and how your presence alone makes everything feel right.</p>
        <p>I don’t know where this will lead, and I don’t expect anything in return. I just wanted you to know how much you mean to me. You’re an incredible person, and no matter what happens, I’ll always cherish the moments we’ve shared.</p>
        <p>So, here I am, putting my heart out there. If you feel the same, I’d love to get to know you even more. But if not, that’s okay too. I just wanted to be honest about how I feel.</p>
        <p>No matter what, you’ll always be someone special to me.</p>
        <p>With all my heart,</p>
        <p>[Your Name]</p>
        <p class="heart">❤❤❤</p>
